```{r}
library(lme4)
str(Dyestuff)
head(Dyestuff)
```


```{r}
fm01 <- lmer(Yield ~ 1 + (1|Batch), Dyestuff)
fm01


```


```{r}
fm01ML <- lmer(Yield ~ 1 + (1|Batch), Dyestuff, REML=FALSE)
fm01ML
```

- Generally the REML estimates of variance
components  are  preferred  to  the  ML  estimates.
- the Batch 37.26% are the percentage explained by Batch 
- the Residual are the percentage can not be explained.
